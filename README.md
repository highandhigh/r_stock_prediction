I used a machine learning algorithms in R to predict stock price.

Use Ray_Script.r file to plot each stock using different prediction model.

Ray_findBestPrediction.r file is responsible for dividing current data into train and test data to apply each prediction model and see which one has the least error. 

OptionallyRunTest.r will run for every stock data you have pulled from input file and see which prediction model works the best.

I invested in two of the most promising stock coming from my own prediction, so it will be interesting to see how they turn out in the near future.
